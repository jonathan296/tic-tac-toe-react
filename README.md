# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple yet engaging Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React and Tailwind CSS. The game offers both player vs player and player vs CPU modes, with a clean and responsive user interface. This project was part of a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)

## Features

- **Player vs Player Mode**: Play with a friend on the same device.
- **Player vs CPU Mode**: Challenge the CPU with a random move selection.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of the scores for both players and ties.
- **Restart Option**: Restart the game at any time without refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy the game on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **React Router**: For navigation between the game menu and the game board.

## How to Play

1. **Select Game Mode**: Choose either "New Game (VS CPU)" or "New Game (VS Player)" from the menu.
2. **Select Player's Mark**: Pick "X" or "O" for Player 1.
3. **Take Turns**: Click on an empty square to place your mark.
4. **Win or Tie**: The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game is a tie.
